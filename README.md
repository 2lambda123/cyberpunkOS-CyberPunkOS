### Cyberpunk OS Script
The script has been created using mainly Python, but also has some parts in Bash. We have based the script on our hypothesis, so we have created the following categories:
- Data Collection and Verification
- Analysis and Visualization
- Web Scrapping
- Social Networks and Analytics
- News Search and Monitoring
- Anonymity and Privacy

### Script cpNews (Cyberpunk News)
We have created a Python script that performs a keyword search across various RSS feeds from the world's leading news outlets. This script can be executed from option 5 (Search and Monitoring News) of the CyberpunkTools script, to then select option number 1 â€“ CyberpunkOS News:

Once option number 1 is selected, we will be asked to enter a keyword for the search, for example Chile. The program will show all the news related to Chile
