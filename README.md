### Script cpNews (Cyberpunk News)
We have created a Python script that performs a keyword search across various RSS feeds from the world's leading news outlets. This script can be executed from option 5 (Search and Monitoring News) of the CyberpunkTools script, to then select option number 1 – CyberpunkOS News:

Once option number 1 is selected, we will be asked to enter a keyword for the search, for example Chile. The program will show all the news related to Chile
